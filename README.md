About the Challenge

Learning about science can be a fun experience! Games that focus on science and environmental issues can create opportunities for players to develop their interests and gain knowledge while engaging with each other in a fun way. Your challenge is to create a game that integrates Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program protocols to help players understand the world around them, develop awareness of one or more local or global environmental topics (e.g., urbanization, water pollution, drought, heat waves, flooding), investigate their local community using GLOBE protocols, or learn scientific principles.

short description of our project
The GLOBE Adventure is a single player game designed to educate players about global and local environmental issues through hands-on activities and interactive challenges. The game includes levels such as learning about the earth's atmosphere, hydrology, urbanization, and heat waves, with a user-friendly interface to engage players. This educational game aims to combine the GLOBE Program's educational elements with engaging gameplay to make learning about science and environmental issues fun and impactful.
